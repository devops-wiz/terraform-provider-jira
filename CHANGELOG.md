# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Important: If you modify files under examples/, you must run `task gen` before pushing. This formats examples and re-generates/validates docs to avoid CI failures.

Note: This section is auto-maintained by Release Drafter (.github/release-drafter.yml). Apply canonical PR labels to categorize changes (see CONTRIBUTING.md). Finalized notes are copied into a versioned section at release time.
