# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{.Description}}

Note: The work_types attribute is a map keyed by work type ID for stability across renames.

## Example Usage

There are 3 ways to use {{.Name}} data source:
*   With no arguments (return all work types)
*   Using the `names` attribute to filter work types by name
*   Using the `ids` attribute to filter work types by id
