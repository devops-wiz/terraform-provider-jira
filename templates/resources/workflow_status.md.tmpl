Valid values for `status_category`: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`.

- TODO — Not started/backlog. Use for statuses like "To Do" where work has not begun.
- IN_PROGRESS — Actively being worked. Use for statuses such as "In Progress", "Implementing", or "Testing".
- DONE — Completed/resolved. Use for terminal statuses such as "Done" or "Resolved"; issues in this category are treated as complete in boards/reports.
