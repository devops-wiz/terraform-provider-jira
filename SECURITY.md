# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We generally fix security issues on the latest released minor version of the provider. Older, unsupported releases may not receive patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Security Advisories to privately report a vulnerability:

1. Navigate to the repository Security tab.
2. Click "Report a vulnerability" to open a private advisory draft.
3. Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the impact.

If you cannot use GitHub Advisories, you may alternatively contact the maintainers through a private channel (e.g., reach out to the repository owners on GitHub to request a secure contact method).

## Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- We will work to verify and remediate the issue. When a fix is available, we will coordinate a release and publish details as appropriate.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service degradation.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to remediate before public disclosure.
- Comply with applicable laws and the terms of the platform(s) used.
