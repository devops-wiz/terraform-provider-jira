# jira_workflow_status (Resource)

Manages a Jira workflow status.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "jira_workflow_status" "test" {
  name            = "Example Status"
  status_category = "TODO"
  description     = "Test Description"
}
```

### Status Categories

Valid values for `status_category`: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`.

- TODO — Not started/backlog. Use for statuses like "To Do" where work has not begun.
- IN_PROGRESS — Actively being worked. Use for statuses such as "In Progress", "Implementing", or "Testing".
- DONE — Completed/resolved. Use for terminal statuses such as "Done" or "Resolved"; issues in this category are treated as complete in boards/reports.

## Additional Examples

- Update name flow:
```terraform
# Update example: change the name of a Jira workflow status by editing and re-applying.
# Initial apply creates the resource; subsequent applies with a new name will update it.

resource "jira_workflow_status" "update_name" {
  name            = "Initial Status Name"
  status_category = "IN_PROGRESS"
  description     = "Initial description"
}
```
