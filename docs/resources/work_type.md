# jira_work_type (Resource)

Manages a Jira work type. Issue types are used to define the structure of different types of issues or work items in your Jira client.

## Example Usage

There are two types of Work types: Standard and Subtask.

### Standard Work Type

```terraform
resource "jira_work_type" "standard_example" {
  name = "Example Issue Type"
  # Optional
  description = "This is an example work type"
  # 0 by default for standard
  hierarchy_level = 0
}
```

### Subtask Work Type

```terraform
resource "jira_work_type" "subtask_example" {
  name = "Example Subtask Issue Type"
  # Optional
  description = "This is an example work type"
  # -1 for subtask
  hierarchy_level = -1
}
```

### Jira Premium

Jira Premium allows custom hierarchy levels for work types. [See the Jira Premium documentation for more information](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-the-issue-type-hierarchy/).

## Additional Examples

- Update description flow:
```terraform
# Update example: change the description of a Jira work type by editing and re-applying.
# Initial apply creates the resource; subsequent applies with a new description will update it.

resource "jira_work_type" "update_desc" {
  name        = "Example Work Type"
  description = "Initial description"
}
```
- Import example (shell):
```sh
# Import a Jira work type by its canonical ID
# Ensure you have a matching resource in your configuration, e.g.:
# resource "jira_work_type" "example" {}
# Then run:
terraform import jira_work_type.example 10000
```

Note: A runnable script is available at examples/resources/jira_work_type/import.sh
