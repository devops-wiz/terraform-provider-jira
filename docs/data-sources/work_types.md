# jira_work_types (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve a list of work types from Jira.

Note: The work_types attribute is a map keyed by work type ID for stability across renames.

## Example Usage

There are 3 ways to use jira_work_types data source:
*   With no arguments (return all work types)
*   Using the `names` attribute to filter work types by name
*   Using the `ids` attribute to filter work types by id

### No Filtering

```terraform
# Minimal example: list Jira work types
# Note: The work_types attribute is a map keyed by work type ID for stability across renames.

data "jira_work_types" "all" {}
```

### Names Filtering

```terraform
# Filter work types by names (case-insensitive matching)
# Replace the example names with those in your Jira instance.

data "jira_work_types" "by_names" {
  names = [
    "Bug",
    "Story",
  ]
}
```

### Ids Filtering

```terraform
# Filter work types by IDs
# The data source returns a map keyed by ID; providing IDs narrows the result set.
# Replace the example IDs with real IDs from your Jira instance.

data "jira_work_types" "by_ids" {
  ids = [
    "10000",
    "10004",
  ]
}
```

## Additional Examples

- Mixed-case names (case-insensitive matching):
```terraform
# Mixed-case name filtering demonstrates case-insensitive matching
# Replace the example names with those in your Jira instance (mixed cases shown).

data "jira_work_types" "mixed_case" {
  names = [
    "bug",
    "STORY",
  ]
}
```

### Nested Schema for `work_types`

Read-Only:

- `avatar_id` (Number) The ID of the avatar for the work type.
- `description` (String) A detailed description of the work type. This helps users understand the purpose and usage of this work type.
- `hierarchy_level` (Number) The level of the work type in the Jira issue type hierarchy:
  - -1: Sub-task (child issue type)
  - 0: Standard issue type (default level)
  - 1: Epic (Epic level)
Higher levels (2+) are available only in Jira Software Premium via Advanced Roadmaps custom hierarchy. Standard editions do not support setting levels above 0 (except -1 for sub-tasks).
