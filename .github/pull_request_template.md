## Checklist (prioritized)

### Critical before merge
- [ ] Acceptance tests executed and passed: `task test:acc` (Task loads .env) â€” if applicable; docs/CI-only PRs may skip.
- [ ] Docs generated and committed:
  - [ ] `task gen` (runs `go generate ./...`) and/or `task docs` (tfplugindocs)
  - [ ] No remaining git diff under `docs/`
  - [ ] Examples changed: ran `task gen` (formats examples and validates/generates docs)
- [ ] (Optional) Add helpful labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`,`github_actions`)
- [ ] No secrets in logs/errors; sensitive values redacted

### Standard checks
- [ ] Imports organized and code formatted (Taskfile): `task goimports` and `task fmt`
- [ ] Lint passes locally: `task lint`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `task build`
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `task test` (or `task test:unit`)
- [ ] Examples/README/docs updated if schema/API changed

### Scope gating (optional)
- [ ] Docs/CI-only: this PR changes only docs/CI/chore files (no `**/*.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `internal/**`, `main.go`, or `templates/**/*.md.tmpl`; Taskfile behavior unchanged). Safe to skip Go/TFPF checks; maintainers may still request full runs.
